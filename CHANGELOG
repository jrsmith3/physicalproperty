1.0.2
=====
Bugfix release

The `physicalproperty` package is pure python and therefore not tied
to a specific architecture or operating system. However, version 1.0.1
was built on an OSX system and flagged as such. Therefore, packages
will not build which depend on `physicalproperty` and are non-OSX.

This release updates the conda build recipe to make this package
architecture agnostic.


1.0.1
=====
Properly package and distribute using conda

This `physicalproperty` package was never hosted on pypi, and it never
had a proper distribution strategy. As of release 1.0.1,
`physicalproperty` is available on binstar.org/jrsmith3 via the
`conda` environment and package manager.
